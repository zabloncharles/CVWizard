## Cover letter and resume
Tailoring your cover letter and resume is one of the best ways to get more interviews. Look at the job posting to identify what the employer is seeking. Specifically, find important words or phrases to use in your profile and key skills sections. You can get inspiration from Resume Builder's cover letter examples to get expert advice on what you should - and shouldn't - include in your cover letter, such as common key skills and action verbs for your desired job.
